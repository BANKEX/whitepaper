\section{Fundamental Advantage of Tokenization for an Asset}

The analytical block of BankEx, gathering and analyzing financial technologies from all over the world for several years, is seeing an interesting trend that has been forming around financial tools during the last few years. 

If we take apart the basic needs of a person or a company in terms of movement of funds, it would be easy to discover that every person or company does not have that many basic financial needs, namely:
    
\begin{itemize}
\item spending money;
\item moving money;
\item storing money;
\item earning money.
\end{itemize}

By correlating these basic financial needs with the current range of financial technologies it turns out that today there is a strong leaning towards saturation of certain needs with financial technologies:
    
\begin{description}
\item[spending money]~--- the need that is most saturated and easiest to digitize. There are currently thousands of companies that help a person or a company to easily and quickly spend their money;
\item[moving money]~--- similar in terms of saturation, but this basic need has several unresolved issues, including ones currently being addressed by our colleagues at Ripple;
\item[storing money]~--- the need for people and companies to keep their money in their pockets is virtually non-existent today, having fully been digitized and moved to plastic cards and a whole range of innovative solutions. 
\end{description}

The BankEx Proof-of-Asset Protocol allows people and organizations to fulfill an important, vital need~--- the need to earn money. By becoming part of the Asset Community you will have the option of earning, and thus realizing yourself in fields of your choosing. 

Cryptocurrencies solve the global issue of digitization of the human need to earn money, and altogether the emergence of cryptocurrencies is a technological response, solving this fundamental issue. 

SmartDeal based on open source Smart Asset by the Proof-of-Asset Protocol is the next step. You will be able to build your future with your own hands.

We use the following notation in our formulas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Trading volume disccount: $D_{Trading Volume}$
    \item Buy/Sell Ratio Discount: $D_{Buy\over{Sell}}$
    \item Total Maker trading volume $V_{Maker}$
    \item Total Taker trading volume $V_{Taker}$
\end{itemize}

Maker:
\begin{equation}
  f_{Maker} = \Big(25-D_{Trading Volume} - D_{Buy \over{Sell}}\Big) \times V_{Maker}
\end{equation}

Taker:
\begin{equation}
    f_{Taker} = \Big(25-D_{Trading Volume}\Big) \times V_{Taker},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
    \text{where}~D_{Trading Volume} =
    \begin{cases} 
        0 & \text{if } V_{Taker} < 10~000~BKX \\
        10 & \text{if } V_{Taker} \geq 10~000~BKX
   \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
    f_{Total} = f_{Maker} - f_{Taker}
